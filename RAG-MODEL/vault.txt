Page 1 of 2 Introduction Learning objectives After completing this module, you'll be able to: • Describe Azure App Service key components and value.• Explain how Azure App Service manages authentication and authorization.• Identify methods to control inbound and outbound traffic to your web app.• Deploy an app to App Service using Azure CLI commands.Examine Azure App Service Azure App Service is an HTTP -based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.You can develop in your favorite programming language or framework.Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux -based environments.Built-in auto scale support The ability to scale up/down or scale out/in is baked into the Azure App Service.Depending on the usage of the web app, you can scale the resources of the underlying machine that is hosting your web app up/down.Resources include the number of cores or the amount of RAM available.
Scaling out/in is the ability to increase, or decrease, the number of machine instances that are running your web app. Container support With Azure App Service, you can deploy and run containerized web apps on Windows and Linux.You can pull container images from a private Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub.Azure App Service also supports multi -container apps, Windows containers, and D ocker Compose for orchestrating container instances.Continuous integration/deployment support The Azure portal provides out -of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine.Connect your web app with any of the above sources and App Service wil l do the rest for you by auto -syncing code and any future changes on the code into the web app.Continuous integration and deployment for containerized web apps is also supported using either Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub.
Page 2 of 2 Deployment slots When deploying a web app you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot when you're running in the Standard App Service Plan tier or better. Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names.App content and configurat ions elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.App Service on Linux App Service can also host web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks.It can also run custom Linux containers (also known as Web App for Containers).App Service on Linux supports many language specific built -in images.Just deploy your code.Supported languages and frameworks include: Node.js, Java (JRE 8 & JRE 11), PHP, Python, .NET, and Ruby.If the runtime your application requires isn't supported in the built-in images, you can deploy it with a custom container.The languages, and their supported versions, are updated regularly.
You can retrieve the current list by using the following command in the Cloud Shell. az webapp list -runtimes --os-type linux Limitations App Service on Linux does have some limitations: • App Service on Linux isn't supported on Shared pricing tier.• The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps.As features are enabled, they're activated on the portal.• When deployed to built -in images, your code and content are allocated a storage volume for web content, backed by Azure Storage.The disk latency of this volume is higher and more variable than the latency of the container filesystem.Apps that require hea vy read-only access to content files might benefit from the custom container option, which places files in the container filesystem instead of on the content volume.

Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 3 Topic 1: Introduction to technical analysis Technical analysis is the study of the past price movements of an individual share or the market as a whole. Charts are the key tool used in technical analysis.The argument in support of technical analysis is that all buying, selling, rumours, and information is going to be factored into the price of a share as people act on that information.By looking at the prices we can see whether there is good news associated with a company resulting in buying and rising prices.We can also see if bad news has come out, or if it's expected to be released because sellers will come into the market and push prices lower.Forget the idea that charts can predict the future with any certainty.They can't and neither can fundamental analysis.So what can charts do for us?The first benefit that charts provide is the ability to convert a table of data into an easy to interpret line graph.
Take the example opposite, is it easier to tell the share's recent price history by looking at the table or the grap h? The graph provides a quick snapshot of how the company's share price has travelled over the recent past.This is charting in its simplest form, let's take a look at how charting can be extended to greater depth of detail.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 4 Topic 2: Chart types Line charts Line charts are the most common type of chart.Line charts plot a series of points to graph price movements.Line charts are an excellent way to get a general guide on the direction a price is moving.Line charts do have limitations in the amount of information that they represent.In the case of share price movements there can be significant variation in a share price over a single time period.
Because a line chart only represents one point in that time period (most commonly the daily closing price) it does not fully represent the fluctuations in that share's price over that period. In order to show more complete price range information, a bar chart can be used.Bar chart A bar chart simply takes the info rmation from the day's trading and plots that information on a single 'bar'.On the right hand side of the graphic opposite is a single day's bar.Bar charts plot price data as a vertical bar.A tab on the left side of the bar represents the OPEN price, and a tab on the right of the bar represents the CLOSE price.The top of the bar represents the day's HIGHEST price and the bottom of the bar represents the day's LOWEST price.By plotting each day consecutively on a chart the technical analyst develops a picture that helps to illustrate the interplay between supply (sellers) and demand (buyers).
While we have drawn a daily bar chart, it is just as easy to draw a weekly chart by capturing the open on Monday, the highest high and the lowest low during the week and finally the close on Friday afternoon. We can also construct monthly bar charts and even 1 -minute bar charts.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 5 Candle stick charts Candlestick charts originated in Japan and have been used for centuries.They are constructed using the same information as a bar chart (open, high, low, and close).Instead of using a single line however, a rectangle is used to represent the area between the open and the close.The rectangle or candle is left blank or a specific c olour like green for an up day and filled or a different colour like red for a down day.The rectangle is called the body or the real body and the single lines at the top or the bottom, if they exist, are called shadows, wicks or tails.
The art of using b ar charts and candle stick charts comes in interpreting the shapes that they form and their combinations. There are a myriad of documented combinations that exist and the charting li brary on the ASX website is a great place to start delving into the world of charting.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 6 Topic 3: Trend analysis Now that we have some background on the different chart types, line, bar and candle stick, we need to use some basic rules to provide us with guidance as to whether prices are rising, falling or have no clear trend.Defining an uptrend The diagram opposite illustrates how easy it is to define an uptrend.Notice that each subsequent h igh is higher than the previous high, while each subsequent low is also higher than the previous low.This is how an uptrend is defined.You must have higher highs AND higher lows.You need both to have an uptrend.If you do not have both a higher high and a higher low you do not have an uptrend.
You might not have a downtrend either. Let's look at the alternatives.Defining a downtrend The diagram opposite describes a downtrend.The definition of a downtrend is lower lows AND lower highs.If you look at the diagram you can see that each high is lower than the previous one and each low is lower than the previous one.From a technical analyst's perspective you are doing yourself a disservice if you purchase stocks that are in a downtrend.It is deemed prud ent to wait until an uptrend emerges.Markets however are not as simple as the diagrams and there are periods when the market is neither in an uptrend nor a downtrend.The next diagram helps illustrate this point.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 7 In the diagram opposite, prices never reach a point where there is a higher high AND a higher low.After the market registered the second higher high, notice that the market then made a lower low.
There is neither an uptrend, nor a downtrend, the market is merely trading sideways with little indication of clear direction. There are technical analysis tools available to allow you to trade in a sideways trending market, though these are not covered in this course.For most investors, a sideways trending m arket represents a time to stand aside and do nothing.Recognising a change of trend We have now defined an uptrend and a downtrend as well as a period of range trading or sideways movement.How do we make use of them in the market place?Obviously we w ould like to get out of downtrends as soon as they develop and we would like to enter into uptrends as soon as they are confirmed.Now that we know what these things are, let's look at identifying a change in trend.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 8 In the diagram opposite it is easy to see that initially there was an uptrend in place.
There is a series of higher highs (H1, H2) AND a series of higher lows (L1, L2, and L3). Notice however that H3 is LOWER than the previous high.This is the first warning, as the criteria for an uptrend is no longer being met.The market is no longer in a clear uptrend.At point H3, we still have higher lows but a lower high.We need both higher lows and higher highs.At point H3, there is no trend either up or down.We may describe the market as neutral or range bound.The price then turned lower and broke the level marked by L3.Now if you look carefully something significant has happened.We have a lower high at H3 and we have a lower low once L3 i s breached.We now have a lower high AND a lower low.A downtrend is in place at the point marked by the arrow.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 9 Topic 4: Resistance and support lines Resistance and support lines Let's look at u sing support and resistance levels to help define the buying and selling points in the market.
Resistance By drawing a line that connects all of the highs we create what is described by technical analysts as a resistance line. At this level the market RE SISTS going higher because there are sellers who enter the market to sell more shares when the share trades at this price.The weight of their cumulative selling prevents the price from rising.If the price were to break through this resistance as it has in the second diagram opposite, it could suggest that the selling at this price is complete or the seller has decided not to sell any more of the stock for the time being.Either way it could be supportive for the stock and may even reflect the release of good news, which has resulted in the sellers at the resistance price holding off or changing their mind.Technical analysts see a break of resistance as a buy signal.Support By drawing a line that connects the lows of the range we can define support.
The price is supported from going lower by the presence of a buyer or buyers at this price. Each time the price drops to this support level a buyer or buying emerges that is of sufficient volume to absorb the selling and prevent the price from falling th rough.Suppose that the price does break through the support level.What would this indicate?The first conclusion we may draw is that the buyer at the previous support price is no longer present (at that price at least).Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 10 The buying has dried up and the selling is continuing now at lower prices.This selling at lower prices suggests that the sellers are becoming more aggressive.Volume Volume is an important tool for the technical analyst.Rising volume at the time of a break of support or resistance is generally regarded as further confirmation that the break is legitimate and that the price is expected to continue moving in the same direction.
This could be for a number of reasons, for example the higher volumes suggest more sophisticated and knowledgeable investors might be establishing positions in the direction of the market's move or it could be simply because more individuals are discovering the particular factors that make an investment or trade in this shar e attractive. Chart patterns There are a multitude of textbooks available for the classic technical analyst.These texts look at the variety of 'patterns' that the market prices form.These patterns are traded by classic technical analysts and like all tools in trading and investing do not work all the time.The diagram opposite describes one pattern known as a rising triangle.There are many others and if you are interested in doing further research on this subject you should consider some of the many texts on the subject that are available.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 11 In the diagram opposite you can see that the resistance line is flat.
This suggests that there is enough selling to absorb the buying at the same price. The support l evel however is sloping upwards.This suggests that the buyers are becoming progressively more aggressive and are increasingly willing to pay higher prices.The question you might ask is why?Well the technical analyst does not concern him or herself with the answer.By looking at the chart we can see that the buyers simply are more aggressive and so the price could go higher.If the price breaks through that resistance level, then the picture is as follows; buyers are more aggressive, paying higher price s and the selling that was evident before has dried up or ceased.According to technical analysts, prices should go higher.If you add rising volume to the picture then you have another validation of the strength being exhibited in the market.
Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 12 Topic 5: Moving averages The moving average The moving average is a common tool and is familiar to many investors and traders. The moving average is simply an average of the closing prices for the last 'n' d ays.'N' equals the number of periods.So a 30 -day moving average will therefore be an average of the closing prices for the last 30 days, rolled forward one day at a time.Similarly a 3 -day moving average will be an average of the last three days, rolled forward one day at a time.The table opposite may help illustrate how we calculate the (3 -day) moving average.All we are doing is adding up the total of the closing prices for the last 'n' period and then dividing by 'n'.This gives us a series of numb ers that we can plot as a line on a price chart.The diagram opposite helps to illustrate what the moving average might look like.
The first step in trading with a moving average is to decide how many days, weeks or months 'n' equals. The larger the numb er, the smoother the moving average will be.You will also have fewer trades and less false signals.The downside is that you will give away a lot of the move before getting in and before getting out.With a shorter term moving average you will get into a trend earlier and exit closer to the top, but you will also have many trades and many false signals, therefore many losing trades.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 13 The common way to trade the moving average is to buy a stock if its price break s above its moving average and to sell it again when the price falls below the moving average.Now before you go racing off to plot the moving average on every stock and buy everything that rises above it a few points are worth remembering.Nothing works all the time.
Indeed the moving average is an indicator that can keep you in an uptrend for its entire duration. It is also good at keeping you out of the market during a downtrend, as the price will remain below the moving average as in the diagram opp osite.In a non -trending market however the moving average will ALWAYS see you lose money when traded in its classic fashion.In a sideways market the moving average will travel through the middle of the prices and force the trader to buy high and sell l ow every time.This is a surefire way to lose money.So a moving average should only be applied to a trending market.Course 11: Technical analysis Version 5 November 2010 14 Summary  Technical analysis is the study of past price movements with the aim of getting guidance to potential future price movements. Charts are the primary tool of technical analysis. There are different types of charts, such as line charts, bar charts and candlestick charts.

The objective of fundamental analysis is to determine a company's intrinsic value or its growth prospects. This intrinsic value can be compared to the current value of the co mpany as measured by the share price.If the shares are trading at less than the intrinsic value then the shares may be seen as good value.Many people use fundamental analysis to select a company to invest in, and technical analysis to help make their bu y and sell decisions.Analysing individual companies The analysis of an individual company has two components:  The 'story' - what the company does, what its outlook is  The 'numbers' - the financials of the company, balance sheet and income statement and ratio analysis.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 4 Unfortunately, balance sheet and ratio analysis is probably the most daunting part of fundamental analysis for non -professional investors.A large number of numerical techniques appear to be use d.
However, you can make it less painful by adopting a methodical approach and by always remembering that behind all the numbers is a real business run by real people producing real goods and services, this is the part we call 'the story'. It is unlikely that you will need to do the number crunching for every company, your time will be more profitably spent developing the company story.Balance sheets and ratio analysis, both historical and forecast, can be obtained from either a full service or discount stockbroker.What are you trying to learn about a company?Before trying to leap into the calculations behind fundamental analysis there are some basic questions that are worth considering as a starting point:  Where is the growth in the company coming fr om? Is the growth being achieved organically or through acquisition? Is turnover keeping pace with the sector and with competitors? What about the profit margin - is it growing?Is it too high compared to competitors?
If it is too high then new competitors could enter on price reducing margins. Low earnings could suggest control of the cost base has been lost or factors outside the company's control are squeezing margins. To what extent do profits reflect one -off events?Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 5  Will profits be sustainable over the long term? Companies are multidimensional.For example debt funding may have increased - this may be a positive move if the funds produce new productive assets.This course will not qualify you to become an acco untant or stock broking analyst.However we will introduce you to the financial statements, (the place where the numbers come from) and introduce the concept of ratio analysis.We will look at some of the most commonly quoted financial ratios; dividend yi eld, Price Earning Ratio (PE) and earnings per share (EPS).In the final topic of this course we have included a Share Appraisal Form.
This is a worksheet that you can use to give some structure to your share selection process. The worksheet builds on wha t you will learn about sourcing information from annual reports and basic ratio calculation.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 november 2010 6 Topic 2: Annual Report Sourcing information The key source of information for all analysts when construc ting the ratios used in fundamental analysis is a company's annual r eport.The annual report is a comprehensive document that provides details on the company's activities over the previous year and what its plans for the future are.Some key elements to the annual r eport are:  Chairman's report  Director's report, and  Financial Statements Annual reports are sent to shareholders of the company.If you are not a shareholder and would like an annual report they are made available in the company announcements section of the ASX website.
Annual reports are generally released at the same time each year during what is known as 'reporting season'. It is in the annual report that you can find a company's balance sheet.The aim of the balance sheet is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.Financial reports also show the results of management performance.This information has a wide number of users so a standard method is set out by the Australian Accounting Standards Board for how to display financial reports.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 7 Financial reports provid e information about an entity's:  Assets - what the company owns  Liabilities - what the company owes  Equity  Income and expenses, including gains and losses  Other changes in equity  Cash flows.
This information, along with other information in the notes, as sists users of financial reports in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty. The main components of a financial report A financial report comprises: 1.A balance sheet ( showing assets and liabilities) 2.An income statement (showing revenue and expenses) 3.A statement of changes in equity showing either:  All changes in equity, or  Changes in equity other than those arising from transactions with equity holders acting in th eir capacity as equity holders 4.A cash flow statement 5.Notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 8 Now what do all these various forms and tables in the financial reports really mean?
It can appear a little confusing at first, but the more time you spend reading annual reports and studying the basic accounting principles that are used in constructing financial reports the easier it becomes to make sense of them. Easy things you can do are che ck the headline figures such as net profit also check cash flow, and level of debt.If you like checking the fine print, the notes to the figures can provide very interesting reading as some key information can get buried in there.You will also find the s alaries of the most senior management and a list of the largest shareholders in the company.If you do find the figures a little daunting, try reading the director's report, usually at the beginning of the annual report.It is a good review of the key ach ievements of the previous year, and will usually give an indication as to what lies ahead.
Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 november 2010 9 Topic 3: Dividend per share & dividend yield Introducing financial ratios When you are researching shares to buy and sell you may make use of analyst reports. These reports are put together by professionals that specialise in reading and interpreting annual reports.Analysts use the raw data from annual reports to create forecasts and calculate financial rati os.Analysts use financial ratios to compare the performance of a company to its previous results, to its competitors, and to industry averages.There are limitations on the effectiveness of ratio analysis, you may experience too much data, the data may b e imperfect, or it may have already been factored into a company's share price reducing its use as a timely signal to act.These limitations aside, reviewing the balance sheet and analyst reports contribute to building an objective case for your share inv estment decisions.
Objectivity means removing the emotion from your decisions. Objectivity is one of the key advantages attached to having an investment strategy.A basic step towards successful investing is to relate a company's performance to the price of its shares.By calculating 'per share' data we can compare earnings, debt and corporate health to a company's share price.There are a multitude of ratios used by analysts to make valuations about a company's shares.In this topic we will look at two im portant ratios used by investors, dividend per share and dividend yield.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 10 Dividend per share (DPS) This is the amount that the company chooses to pay out of net profit to its shareholders, expressed as a number of cents per share.The company has the choice of paying out all of the net profit as a dividend, par t of, or none of the net profit.It depends on whether or not the company needs the money to fund growth or repay debt.
DPS = Total dividend paid = cents per share Number of shares on issue A thorough analyst does not merely observe consistent dividend payment over many years and then determine the investment to be 'safe' and the compan y a 'Blue chip'. It is essential to check if the dividends were paid from the current year's earnings or from retained earnings from previous years.To do that you can check the payout ratio or dividends/earnings which show what percentage of earnings wa s paid out as a dividend.The reciprocal is earnings/dividends which is the dividend cover ratio.If the dividend cover ratio is less than one then the dividends must have been paid out of retained earnings.Sometimes paying out all the earnings as divide nds is not a good thing, for example, in the case of a company being able to obtain an above average rate of return funding expansion or acquisition instead of paying a dividend.
At other times, if the company has surplus cash it may pay out a special div idend or announce a return of capital. Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 11 Dividend yield Dividend yield = DPS = % Share price The dividend yield is the dividend expressed as a percentage of the share price.This is the rate that can be used to compare the income generated from one investment to that from other investments.High dividend yields are attractive but they are a representation of past payouts.They are not a guarantee of future dividend amounts.The dividend yield figure may also be affected by fluctuating share prices.It is important to check to see the level of franking attached to the dividend and what the forecasts are for next year.
(Franking: the amount of tax the company has paid which attaches to the share.) Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 november 2010 12 Topic 4: Earnings per share & PE ratio Earnings per share (EPS) The earnings per share is the portion of the profit earned for every ordinary share on issue. It shows at a glance the growth in earnings from one year to the next and the relative size of earnings to dividends.It is also essential for calculating the Price Earnings ratio.EPS is calculated by taking the net profit, if any, and dividing by the number of o rdinary shares.EPS = Net profit after tax (NPAT) = cents per Number of shares on issue share An EPS figure on its own means very little.The company may not pay this amount out as a dividend or it could include n on- recurring items.It is important that the analyst looks at net profit after tax before any of these non -recurring items referred to as 'abnormal items'.After determining the current EPS, look for trends.
Has EPS been growing or falling, and how much i s from normal operations rather than one off events? If EPS is the same as last year, has there been an increase in the shares on issue?Remember EPS does not lend itself to the determination of 'quality'.In bear markets analysts look much more closely a t the quality of earnings and quickly dismiss one - off items.(Bear market: a term used to describe a market that is falling, this is the opposite of a bull market.) Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 November 2010 13 Price earnings ratio - PE ratio The PE ratio is simply the share price divided by the earning per share (EPS).PE ratio = Share price = times earnings EPS covered by price The PE ratio shows how many times, in years, it will take for your purchase to be covered by earnings.The PE ratio reflects the market's view of the earnings potential of the company.
A low PE ratio suggests that the market expects no growth or lower profits, while a high PE ratio suggests that the market expects high growth and a higher profit. Compare the PE ratio of a company you are looking at to that of other companies in the same sector and the market as a whole.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 november 2010 14 Topic 5: Share appraisal form We have i ncluded a resource that you may find useful in developing your own approach to conducting fundamental analysis.We have called it the Share Appraisal Form.Essentially it is like a health check for companies and provides a methodology that you can work thr ough to help give some order to your decision making.Remember to read through the disclaimers on the form, this is not a guaranteed method for investment success but one approach that may provide you with assistance.Course 10: Fundamental analysis Version 5 november 2010 15 Summary  When you buy shares you are becoming a part owner in that business.
 To make an informed decision if you want to be an owner in that business, it is important to understand how that company operates and what its prospects are.  To understand a c ompany you can read its annual report which is one of the most important publications it releases to the market. Analysing an annual report gives you the ability to build a good picture of how that business has performed over the past 12 months and what its prospects might be for the future. To compare the annual reports and prospects of different companies, there are commonly used financial ratios, these include dividend per share, dividend yield, PE ratio and earnings per share.
