      "ai": "You can handle timeouts in Python using the `timeout` parameter in the `requests` library. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ntry:\n    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com', timeout=5)\n    print(response.content)\nexcept requests.Timeout:\n    print('The request timed out')\n```"

      "user": "Thanks! That makes sense. Is there a way to retry the request if it times out?",
      "ai": "Yes, you can use a loop to retry the request. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nfor i in range(3):  # Retry up to 3 times\n    try:\n        response = requests.get('https://api.example.com', timeout=5)\n        print(response.content)\n        break  # Exit loop if the request is successful\n    except requests.Timeout:\n        print(f'Retry {i+1} failed. Retrying...')\n```"
